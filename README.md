Python Flask on Heroku
==================

This is a static portfolio site for deployment on Heroku. A minimal working version of a bootstrapped site using the [grayscale theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) can be accessed from earlier commits.

This site is live at [www.heidiwhiting.com](www.heidiwhiting.com) and is running on Python 3.6.4.
